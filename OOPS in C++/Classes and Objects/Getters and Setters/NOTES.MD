# The Role of Getters and Setters in Object-Oriented Programming

Getters and setters are a pair of methods commonly used in object-oriented programming to control access to the attributes or properties of an object. They play a crucial role in implementing the concept of data encapsulation, ensuring data security and integrity. Here's an overview of their roles:

1. **Getters (Accessors):**
   - Getters are methods used to retrieve the values of private attributes from a class.
   - They provide read-only access to the attributes, allowing controlled retrieval of data without exposing the internal implementation details of the class.
   - Getters enable secure access to private data, preventing direct external modification and ensuring data protection.

2. **Setters (Mutators):**
   - Setters are methods used to modify the values of private attributes in a class.
   - They provide a way to update the values of private data members, allowing controlled modification with data validation and consistency checks.
   - Setters enforce constraints on the values assigned to the attributes, ensuring data integrity and preventing the storage of invalid data.

By utilizing getters and setters, one can maintain the integrity of the class's data, control its access and modification, and implement additional logic and validation checks, making the class more robust and secure.
