# Understanding Classes in Object-Oriented Programming

- A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.
- It defines the properties (data members) and behaviors (member functions) that objects of that class can have.
- A class encapsulates the data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit.
- It serves as a user-defined data type, allowing for the creation of custom data structures and behaviors.

# Understanding Different Types of Members in a Class

A class in object-oriented programming consists of various types of members that contribute to its structure and behavior. These members include:

1. **Data Members:**
   - Represent the attributes or properties of objects.
   - Can be private, protected, or public.
   - are variables within a class that represent the state or characteristics of objects.
   - They encapsulate the data associated with the objects of the class.

2. **Member Functions:**
   - Operate on the data members of the class.
   - Used to manipulate data and perform specific actions associated with the    objects of the class.

3. **Constructor:**
   - Special member function used to initialize the object's state during its creation.
   - Shares the same name as the class.

4. **Destructor:**
   - Special member function used to release resources and perform cleanup operations.
   - Shares the same name as the class, preceded by a tilde (~).

5. **Static Members:**
   - Shared among all objects of a class.
   - Independent of any specific object and maintains common values or behaviors.

6. **Constant Members:**
   - Data members or member functions that cannot be modified after object creation.
   - Declared using the "const" keyword.

7. **Friend Functions and Classes:**
   - Have access to the private and protected members of a class.
   - Declared using the "friend" keyword.
