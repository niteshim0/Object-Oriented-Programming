# Understanding Access Modifiers in C++

Access modifiers in C++ are keywords used to define the access control for the members of a class. There are three main types of access modifiers:

1. **Public Access Modifier:**
   - The `public` access modifier allows the class members to be accessible from outside the class through the class object.
   - Public members can be accessed and modified by any function.

2. **Private Access Modifier:**
   - The `private` access modifier restricts the access of the class members to within the class itself.
   - Private members are not accessible from outside the class, including its derived classes.
   - They can only be accessed or modified by other member functions of the same class.

3. **Protected Access Modifier:**
   - The `protected` access modifier allows the derived classes to access the base class members.
   - Protected members are similar to private members, but they can be accessed in the derived classes, enabling inheritance and data hiding.

| Access Specifier | Within class                            | Outside class                  |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Private          | Accessible                              | Not accessible                 |
| Protected        | Accessible                              | Not accessible (except in derived classes) |
| Public           | Accessible                              | Accessible                     |

# Default Access Modifiers in C++

In C++, the default access modifiers for classes are different depending on the type of class. Below are the default rules for access modifiers in different types of classes:

1. **Class:**
   - The default access specifier for a class is "private". If you declare members within a class without specifying an access modifier, they are considered private.

2. **Struct:**
   - The default access specifier for a struct is "public". If you declare members within a struct without specifying an access modifier, they are considered public.

3. **Union:**
   - The default access specifier for a union is "public". Similar to a struct, if you declare members within a union without specifying an access modifier, they are considered public.

It is considered good practice to explicitly define the access modifiers for the members of a class, struct, or union to ensure code clarity and prevent unexpected behavior. Explicitly specifying the access modifiers also makes the code more maintainable and easier to understand for other developers.
