## Understading Destructor in C++

- It is an instance member function of a class that is responsible for releasing resources and performing any necessary cleanup when an object is destroyed or goes out of scope.
- The syntax for a destructor is the same as that of a constructor, but it is preceded by a tilde (~).
- It can never be static same as constructors.
- It has no return type.
- It takes no argument so no any destructor overloading is not possible.
- It is invoked implicitly when object is going to destroy.
- A class can have only one destructor, and it cannot have parameters or return types.

## Popular Confusion regarding Destructors
- The confusion about the destructor stems from the misconception that it directly destroys the object. However, in reality, the destructor is the last function that gets called before an object is destroyed, allowing for any necessary cleanup operations to be performed.

- The destructor's main purpose is to release resources and perform any required cleanup, such as deallocating memory, closing files, or releasing other resources that were allocated during the object's lifetime. The actual destruction of the object itself is handled by the compiler.

- Understanding the role of the destructor as the final function called before an object's destruction is essential for managing resources and ensuring proper cleanup in C++ programs.
